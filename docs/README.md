# App Documentation

As a technical writer, one of my key goals is putting documentation where it's needed. As a coder, my key goal is to make human-friendly tools. The net result is that most documentation is in the script files vs. here. 

* The repo's [`README.md`](./../README.md) has the need-to-know information - requirements, installation, usage. 
* Broadly, `configure.py` is the important file - here you can customize an app's defaults to match your workflow. 
* And `requirements.txt` includes links to each module's documentation. 
* The script files have doc strings + helpful comments, and write `/logs` files.
